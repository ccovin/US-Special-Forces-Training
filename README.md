# US-Special-Forces-Training

 A great experience! 

SITUATION:
Budget overruns in Special Forces training have become a significant inhibitor with the onset of the U.S. Federal Budget  Sequestration rules. 

METHODOLOGY:
Over the course of 120+ research interviews with SF personnel we employed Lean Startup and Design Thinking techniques to design a system to Capture, Synthesize, and Enhance each training cycle. 

RESULT:
Initial tests indicated increased budgetary accuracy of at least 50% Year 1 with compounding improvements going forward. Additionally, the sytem opened the door to unprecendented analytical and force management capabilities. 

Our Special Forces sponsors were ecstatic and we were poised to formally incorporate a new company. Ironically, our military sponsors could not secure funding to move forward due to the budget sequestration. 

WHAT IS IN THIS REPOSITORY:
This repository contains a handful of the 50+ designs from our high-fidelity prototype. The full set and interactive prototype are not publicly available.
